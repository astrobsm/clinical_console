Subject: Database Schema Creation - Grant CREATE Privileges

Hello,

I need to create tables for my application deployed on DigitalOcean App Platform.

Database Details:
- Host: astrobsmvelvet-db-do-user-23752526-0.e.db.ondigitalocean.com
- Database: plasticsurgunit_db
- User: clinical_console

Current Issue:
My user "clinical_console" has "permission denied for schema public" when trying to CREATE TABLE.

Request:
Please either:
1. Grant CREATE, ALTER, DROP privileges on schema public to user "clinical_console"
2. Or provide admin credentials so I can create the required tables
3. Or execute the attached SQL file (create_tables.sql) as an admin user

The SQL file contains the database schema for a medical EMR system with proper tables for users, patients, appointments, etc.

Alternative SQL to grant privileges:
```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO clinical_console;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO clinical_console;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO clinical_console;
```

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
